# CPU_in_VHDL

## Project Description
This project implements a 16-bit RISC CPU using VHDL. The CPU is designed for multi-cycle execution and supports various arithmetic, logical, memory, and control instructions. The aim of this project is to design and implement a simple CPU that performs all essential operations, adhering to the RISC principles.

The design includes a complete set of components such as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Register File, Memory Unit, Multiplexers, and Control Logic. It executes instructions in multiple cyclesâ€”fetching, decoding, executing, and writing back data.

For more details on the problem statement, refer to the Project Question Paper PDF.

## Features
- **16-bit RISC ISA**: Implements a reduced instruction set, categorized into R-Type, I-Type, and J-Type instructions.
- **Multi-Cycle Execution**: Instruction execution is divided into 3 stages:
  1. Fetching the instruction and required data.
  2. Executing the required operations.
  3. Storing results and updating the Program Counter (PC).
- **Component-Based Design**: Includes an ALU, Register File, Memory Unit, Multiplexers, Sign Extensions, and Control Logic.
- **Fully developed in VHDL**, simulated using ModelSim, and synthesized with Quartus Prime.
- Supports instructions for arithmetic, logical, memory access, and branching operations.

## Supported Instructions

### R-Type Instructions
Used for arithmetic and logical operations.

| Instruction | Operation         | Description                           |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `ADD`       | `RD = RS + RT`    | Adds two registers.                   |
| `SUB`       | `RD = RS - RT`    | Subtracts one register from another.  |
| `AND`       | `RD = RS AND RT`  | Bitwise AND between two registers.    |
| `OR`        | `RD = RS OR RT`   | Bitwise OR between two registers.     |
| `MUL`       | `RD = RS * RT`    | Multiplies two registers.             |

### I-Type Instructions
Used for immediate operations and memory access.

| Instruction | Operation           | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `ADDI`      | `RS = RS + IMM`     | Adds an immediate value to a register.|
| `LW`        | `RS = MEM[IMM]`     | Loads data from memory into a register.|
| `SW`        | `MEM[IMM] = RS`     | Stores data from a register into memory.|

### J-Type Instructions
Used for jump and branch operations.

| Instruction | Operation           | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `J`         | `PC = Address`      | Jumps to a specified address.         |
| `BEQ`       | `if (RS == RT) PC = Address` | Branches if two registers are equal. |

## CPU Workflow
The CPU executes instructions in the following steps:

### Instruction Fetch and Data Preparation
- The Program Counter (PC) fetches the next instruction from memory.
- Decodes the instruction to identify the operation type (R-Type, I-Type, or J-Type).
- Fetches required data (registers, immediate values, or memory) based on the instruction type.

### Execution
- Performs the operation (arithmetic, logical, memory, or branch) as defined by the instruction.
- Utilizes the ALU for arithmetic/logical operations.
- For memory instructions, accesses data memory using calculated addresses.

### Write Back and PC Update
- Stores the result back into the target register or memory location.
- Updates the Program Counter (PC) for the next instruction.

## Software Used
- **ModelSim**: For simulating and testing the VHDL design.
- **Quartus Prime**: For synthesizing and verifying the hardware implementation.

## Documentation
- **Project Question Paper PDF**: Contains the original problem statement.
- **Final Report PDF**: Detailed report of the project, including the design methodology and results.
